## Requirements

The experimental StarterKit for Twig requires the following PatternEngine:

* `pattern-lab/patternengine-twig`: [documentation](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-twig#twig-patternengine-for-pattern-lab), [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-twig), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/patternengine-twig)

## Install

This StarterKit can be installed using the following command:

Use "r" when prompted to replace the entire source folder if you have already installed a kit in your PatternLab project.
